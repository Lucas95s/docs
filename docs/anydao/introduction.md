# Introduction

Voting is one of the most important components for DAO. Currently there are two major approaches: off-chain signalling and on-chain governance. Due to the sensitivity and indeterminate design of on-chain infrastructure for different project, there is no an easy approach to have a universal pattern to apply to most of the cases and it requires abundant knowledge and thorough understanding to practice on-chain governance, currently there are very few teams have the ability to adopt it. Thus off-chain signalling is still the major approach for DAO to involve the community to make decisions.

However for off-chain signalling voting, there are also several major problems faced:

- Island of Voting Power: Nowadays most of WEB3.0 projects locate their assets across different chains, usually users have to bridge their assets to a specific chain designated by the project team to have the right to vote. It causes unnecessary waste for the intermediate transactions and can even cause a liquidity crisis.
- Privacy Concern: Anonymous voting will greatly promote users' motivation to get involved in the voting. But due to the nature of traceability of blockchain networks, it is always a challenge to achieve true anonymity.

**AnyDAO** is an off-chain voting signalling platform built by Automata Network aiming to solve the above challenges. Currently it already supports the following major features:<br>

- **Boarderless Governance**: Vote aggregation across any EVM or Substrate-based blockchain networks<br>

- **Zero-cost voting**: User-friendly process<br>

- **Multi-tier privacy**: Adjustable privacy levels<br>
  
- **Flexible parameters**: Choose from different token standards, such as with ERC20s, NFTs, LP tokens or Native Substrate Account Balances.
