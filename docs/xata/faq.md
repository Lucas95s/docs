# FAQ
Frequently asked questions.

* **Will there be a XATA token?**

    There are no plans to launch a XATA token at the moment. Please do not engage in any form of trade or liquidity farming with any XATA token out there in the wild.
    
* **Are there any risks in providing liquidity to a liquidity pool such as ATA/USDT?**

    Yes. All liquidity farming activities are subjected to the risk of impermanent loss. We suggest doing your own calculations as to whether yield farming and earning LP fees are more profitable than holding ATA to decide on the best course of action.

* **How do I connect on my mobile browser?**

    Select Wallet Connect, which will generate a QR code. Use the mobile Metamask app to scan the QR code to approve transactions on your mobile browser.
    
* **Why was my transaction rejected?**

    There are many possible reasons. One of the most common is that users have insufficient tokens or propose too low a transaction fee. Periods of network congestion can also result in rejected transactions. If there's urgency to access a particular network, consider using other RPCs for each of these chains based on the articles below:
