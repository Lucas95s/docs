* **Would there be a XATA token?**

    There is no XATA token launched at the moment. Please do no engage in any form of trade or liquidity farming with any XATA token out there at the moment.
    
* **Are there any risks in providing to a liquidity pool like ATA/USDT?**

    Yes. All liquidity farming activities are subjected to the risk of impermanent loss. You will need to do your own calculations as to whether yield farming and earning LP fees are more profitable than holding ATA itself to decide on the best choice of action.

    This might be due to the fact that you have not enough tokens to pay for fees, or that the network is congested at the moment.
