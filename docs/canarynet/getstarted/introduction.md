# ContextFree Network

ContextFree is the Canary Network of Automataâ€™s Mainnet, and this is an important milestone in realizing the technological vision of a privacy middleware platform built for Web 3.0.

The launch of ContextFree provides a pre-production environment for real-life learnings to be applied to the eventual rollout of the Mainnet. During this time, users are invited to battle-test the code. Features are rolled out in phases to ensure the stability and security of the blockchain.

This documentation homepage offers the necessary resources to learn about ContextFree, guides and tools to contribute to the Canary Network, either as a user looking to explore the blockchain, or to participate by running a node. Here are some background information to get you started:
